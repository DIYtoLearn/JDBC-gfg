What is caching?

Caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage so that it can be retrieved faster for future requests, reducing the need to fetch data from the original source
(like a db or an api)

Benifts
-----------

1. Faster Performance
2. Reduces Server Load
3. Improves user experience
4. Supports Offline/edge use
5. Reduced Latency


How Caching works
------------------

1. User requesrs data -> cache check

2. if data is present (cache hit) -> cache return

3. if data absent(cache miss) -> fetch from original source (db) 
                                 store in cache
                                 return


cache hit -> data found

cache miss -> data not found in cache

TTL(time to live) ->  Duration after which a cache entry expires

Eviction   -> Removal of old or unused cache entries (based on poilicy)

stale data -> Outdated cache content due to source updates


Types Of Caching
------------------

1.  In memory Cache

    - Data stored in the Ram of the application server
    - Example HashMap ,ConcurrentHashMap, Guava, Echahce
    - very fast but limited by memory,
